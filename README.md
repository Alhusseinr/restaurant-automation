1. Before starting the project make sure you have Postgresql installed from here `https://www.postgresql.org/download/`
2. In terminal run `npm run installDep` to install all dependencies of the project
3. Open `pgAdmin 4` and create a new database and call it `restaurant`
4. Back in your terminal run this script `seqeulize db:migrate`

with this you should be able to run the project, call the API, and interact with the database
